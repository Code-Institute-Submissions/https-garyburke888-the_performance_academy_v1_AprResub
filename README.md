# User Experience (UX)

## Purpose & Aim of the Project
**The Performance Academy** is an eCommerce, information and discussion website for a performing arts school that offers different types of classes for all ages. The site allows users to search for classes, book and pay (via Stripe) for them and register for an account. It also offers a blog and discussion boards where users can post, interact and converse.

## Design Process
Before laying out the site and creating the initial design, some market research was done and the following queries were brought to the foee;
-   Do other performing arts schools offer similar classes and online booking mechanisms?
-   If so, what is their design, how do their sites look?
-   What are common design concepts across performing arts school sites that should be included?
-   What's missing, that I can add.
-   Which ones, or what parts of them do I like?
-   What concepts fit in with my school's idea?

There are many performing arts schools and sites out there with a wide range of ideas. I wanted this one to be minimilist, with a dark 'cool' theme that appeals to most ages but most importantly I wanted people to be able to find what they want, book and pay for it with as little steps as possible. After that, I wanted to create the beginnings of a community for people interested in the performing arts.

## Target Group
The site is aimed at both parents and students of all ages, as the school offers classes from ages 3yrs up to adults. The typical age of a shopper is estimated to be between 18 and 45 years but may be influenced by the child who may want to attend a particular class. The classes have a diverse spread of disciplines to entice as many students to participate in their preferred field. The income of the target group is an average mid to high household income. Furthermore the target group has a passion for engaging in extra curricular activites.

# Layout, Styling & Wireframes

## Structure
There are 9 main pages including the home page and a login/registration page. Other than these, there is a base page which serves as the base for all the other pages.

### Home Page
The home page gives a quick glance at the brand of the site and a link to the booking page.

### Booking/Classes Page
This page provides a list of classes which users can book. There are filters and a sort function to aid in the search. Once they click into a class, it takes them to a page which provides a bit more information about that class and from here, they can add it to their shopping bag.

### Shopping Bag Page
Users can add this to their shopping bag and go to checkout or keep adding more classes. The shopping bag shows the total which is calculated automatically based on the classes they add. They can delete the class if no longer required or if they want to add more classes, there is a button which takes them back to book more classes. Once they have added all the classes to the shopping bag, they can go to the Checkout page by clicking on the checkout button link.

### Checkout Page
Here the user can enter their billing details to complete the checkout. If they need to update the shopping bg at any point before billing, they have the option to go back to the main site by clicking on a button. In this page, the users are provided with an option to save their details by logging into the site. If they don't want that option, they can click on Complete Order button to complete the transaction which triggers an automatic mail to their email address provided with the necessary details. If they want to save the details for future, they can register or login from the page or from the navbar.

### Login Page
The users are provided with the option to register/login to create an account. For new users, they can redirect to the Sign up page from here. They need to include their email address, name and password to sign up. Once that is done, a confirmation link will be sent to their email address. Once the email is confirmed, they can login to the site. Logged in users have the ability to navigate to the Profile page and post a topic / reply in the Boards app.

### Profile Page
Logged in users can update their billing details from this page. If they have made any previous bookings, those details are also shown on this page.

### Logout Page
For users logged in, they can click on the logout button which takes them to this page to confirm that they want to logout. Clicking on the Sign out button logs them out from the site.

### Blog Page
Admin can post articles to the blog ansd they will show up here, in Bootstrap cards. Article content is truncated and users can click on a 'read more' link to be taken to the full article. From here they can then also click on a 'back to blog' link to get back to the main blog page.

### Boards Page
![Boards](media/tpa_boards.jpg)

All users can view the Boards page which is a table with links to all the diffferent boards available. Clicking on a board title will take the user to that boards topic page, where a bunch of topics will be listed. A logged in user can add a new topic here. All users can read topic posts by clicking on the topics title. A logged in user can post to a topic or post a reply in a topic. Only a user who created a post, or admin, can delete that post.

### Site Management

8. Type ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` into Terminal
9. Setup the environment variables. This process is differnet depending on the used IDE. Gitpod supports global Environments for the development process. Therefore they were stored in the settings. The following variables are needed;
    ```
    DEVELOPMENT=True   
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = <YOUR STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY>
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = <YOUR STRIPE_SECRET_KEY>
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = <YOUR STRIPE_WH_SECRET>
    ```
10. Migrate the models and create the database by typing the following commands into the terminal;
    1. ```python3 manage.py makemigrations```  
    2. ```python3 manage.py migrate```
11. Import the provided fixtures in the correct order;
    1. ```python3 manage.py loaddata categories```
    2. ```python3 manage.py loaddata ages```
    3. ```python3 manage.py loaddata settings```
    4. ```python3 manage.py loaddata classes```
12. Create a superuser for accessing the django admin view with the following command:
    ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser``` You will be asked for an email address, username and password.
13. You should be all set and when using the command ```python3 manage.py runserver``` the project should run.
14. You can access the django admin view by adding ```~/admin``` to the end of your (local) URL.

## Deployment to Heroku: Step-by-Step Instructions
This project is deployed to Heroku. For the deployment the following steps were/are necessary:
1. Create/Log in to your Heroku account and create a new App.
2. Install Heroku Add-on Heroku Postgres from the Resources tab. The free ```Hobby Dev``` version is fine. Now click the Provision button to add it to your project.
3. Create requirements.txt from your project with the help of ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt``` (already provided within the repository)
4. Create a Procfile ```echo web: gunicorn puffins.wsgi:application > Procfile``` (already provided within the repository)
5. Commit changes to Git ```git add .``` followed by ```git commit -m "Deploy: Updated Procfile"``` (already provided within the repository)
6. Set the environment variables in Heroku Settings > Reveal Config Variables
    The following Variables must be set;
    ```
    DATABASE_URL = <YOUR DATABASE_URL> (Set by Heroku Postgres)
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = <YOUR EMAIL_HOST_USER>

    SECRET_KEY = <YOUR SECRET_KEY>
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = <YOUR STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY>
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = <YOUR STRIPE_SECRET_KEY>
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = <YOUR STRIPE_WH_SECRET>
    ```
7. Extract the DATABASE_URL Value from the Heroku Settings and set it up in your IDE or local .env file. Make sure to keep this DATABASE_URL a secret and definitly don't commit it to Github.
8. To test if the Postgres database is connected to your IDE you can make use of the command ```python3 manage.py showmigrations```. This should show undone migrations for all models.
9. Now migrate the models and create the postgres database on heroku by typing the following commands into the terminal;
    1. ```python3 manage.py makemigrations```  
    2. ```python3 manage.py migrate```
10. To setup the data in the database import the provided fixtures in the correct order; 
    1. ```python3 manage.py loaddata categories```
    2. ```python3 manage.py loaddata ages```
    3. ```python3 manage.py loaddata settings```
    4. ```python3 manage.py loaddata classes```
11. Create a superuser for the Postgres database for accessing the django admin view with the following command:
    ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser``` You will be asked for an email address, username and password.
12. Log in to heroku from your terminal ```heroku login```
13. Add exisitng repository to Heroku heroku ```git:remote -a <your repository>```
