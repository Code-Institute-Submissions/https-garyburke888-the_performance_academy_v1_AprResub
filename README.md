### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
-   

### Site UI/UX & Browser Compatibility Testing
-   Manual testing was carried out on this site by the developer's family members to review the UX and site responsivness.
-   Chrome dev tools were used to review responsivness on multiple devices;
    - Moto G4
    - Galaxy S5

### Known Bugs
-   Webhooks from Stripe not working, despite efforts to remedy, a 401 error remains, though payment information can be sent to Stripe without issue.

## Deployment
This project was created using Github. From there I used Gitpod to write my code. Then I used commits to git followed by pushes to my GitHub repository. I've deployed this project to Heroku. For deployment on Heroku I've used the following steps;
-   Within the Heroku dashboard, click 'new' app.
-   Give it a name and select the 'region' closest to you.
-   Under 'resources' seacrh postgres and select 'Heroku Postgres'.
-   Slect the 'free' plan.
-   Return to GitPod and do 'pip3 install dj_database_url' followed by 'pip3 install psycopg2-binary'.
-   Freeze these requirments with the 'pip3 freeze > requirements.txt' command.
-   In settings.py, import dj_database_url.
-   Copy database url from Heroku settings (under config vars) and paste in into settings.py - instead of the current settings for database.
-   Migrate these changes with the 'python3 manage.py migrate' command.
-   Run 'python3 manage.py loaddata xxx' command for each fixtures, filling in each fixture name where the xxx is, in the correct order.
-   Run 'python3 manage.py createsuperuser' command and follow the prompts.
